-> In computing, a compiler is a computer program that translates computer code written in one programming language (the source language) into another language (the target language).
-> The various types of compilers: a) GCC - GNU Compiler Collection
				   b) Clang
-> The Components of the C Program Compilation Pipeline are: Preprocessor | Compilation | Assembly | Linker.
-> Preprocessor removes comments, replaces macros with their values, and includes the libraries.To produce a file from the preprocess only, we use the -E option and it will produce a .i file.
-> Compilation process produces an assembly code with a .s file extension that is still human readable but closer to hardware. To produce assembly code only, we use -S option with gcc.
-> Assembly generates a relocatable object file from the assembly code with a .o extension. We use -c option to produce an object code with the gcc.
-> Linking involves linking together all the object code to produce an executable code.
