					HOUR 1
<pre>
-> Organization is the key to writing good programs.
-> While commenting out the program, you are halfway in writing it in C.
-> Computers can only execute machine code.
-> A program presents the computer with a set of instructions and the provides the programmer
   with a clear, easy-to-read description of what the program does.
-> A program should read like an essay(should be clear and easy to understand as possible).
-> A variable is a place in the computer's memory to store a value.
-> Every variable in C must be declared.
-> Proper indentation and code format should be consistent throughout the code.
-> A good program should be organized into sections.
-> A program should be concise and easy to read.

						HOUR 2
<pre>
-> Variables are the building blocks of a program and the instructions tell the computer what to do with the variables.
-> Comments are used to describe the variables and instructions.
-> Basic structure in C is a function and combined functions form a program.
-> return (0) indicates the programm exited normally, otherwise a non-zero value will indicate an error.
-> Semicolon is used in C to end a statement.
-> printf is used in C to output a message.
-> In arithmetic, multiply, divide and modulus have precedence over add and subtract. 
-> Parentheses can be used to change this precedence.
-> Variable names identify memory location which hold values and each variable has a type.
-> Variable declaration defines the name, type, and gives a description of the variable.
-> Integer numbers have no fractional part or decimal point.
-> Computers use binary digits called bits and 8 bits make a byte.
-> Assignment statements are used to give a variable a value.
-> Floating point are also known as real numbers.
-> Floating point must contain a decimal point.
-> %f is the format specifier to display a floating point with printf.
-> In integer division, the result is truncated.
-> char represents single characters.
-> Backslash character \ is called the escape character.
