<pre>
-> Organization is the key to writing good programs.
-> While commenting out the program, you are halfway in writing it in C.
-> Computers can only execute machine code.
-> A program presents the computer with a set of instructions and the provides the programmer
   with a clear, easy-to-read description of what the program does.
-> A program should read like an essay(should be clear and easy to understand as possible).
-> A variable is a place in the computer's memory to store a value.
-> Every variable in C must be declared.
-> Proper indentation and code format should be consistent throughout the code.
-> A good program should be organized into sections.
-> A program should be concise and easy to read.
</pre>
							HOUR 2
<pre>
-> Variables are the building blocks of a program and the instructions tell the computer what to do with the variables.
-> Comments are used to describe the variables and instructions.
-> Basic structure in C is a function and combined functions form a program.
-> return (0) indicates the programm exited normally, otherwise a non-zero value will indicate an error.
-> Semicolon is used in C to end a statement.
-> printf is used in C to output a message.
-> In arithmetic, multiply, divide and modulus have precedence over add and subtract. 
-> Parentheses can be used to change this precedence.
-> Variable names identify memory location which hold values and each variable has a type.
-> Variable declaration defines the name, type, and gives a description of the variable.
-> Integer numbers have no fractional part or decimal point.
-> Computers use binary digits called bits and 8 bits make a byte.
-> Assignment statements are used to give a variable a value.
-> Floating point are also known as real numbers.
-> Floating point must contain a decimal point.
-> %f is the format specifier to display a floating point with printf.
-> In integer division, the result is truncated.
-> char represents single characters.
-> Backslash character \ is called the escape character.
</pre>
							HOUR 3
<pre>
-> An array is a set of consecutive memory locations used to store data of the same type.
-> Indexing of arrays starts at zero.
-> Strings are sequences of characters.
-> NULL character '\0' is used to indicate the end of a string.
-> C does not allow one array to be assigned to another.
-> strcpy is used to copy the string constant into the variable.
-> strcpy copies the whole string including the NULL character.
-> Strings are surrounded by double quotes and character by single quotes.
-> length of a string = strlen(string).
-> %s is the format specifier for printing string variables using printf function.
-> fgets can be used to read a string from the standard input.
-> Syntax for fgets: fgets(name, sizeof(name), stdin);
-> Arrays can have more than one dimension.
-> scanf function can be used to read in number.
-> scanf is very poor at end-of-line handling.
-> C allows variables to be initialized in the declaration statement.
-> long qualifier informs C to allocate extra storage for the integer.
-> short qualifier informs C to reduce the storage.
-> unsigned numbers provide a way of doubling the positive range at the expense of eliminating negative numbers.
-> unsigned numbers are useful for counters and indices and other values that can never be negative.
-> float denotes normal precision and double denotes double precision.
-> double is used in most cases where accuracy is a problem.
-> Constants must be initialized at declaration time and can never be changed.
-> A zero before a number indicate the number is of base 8, while 0x before a number indicates its of base 16.
-> A side effect is an operation that is performed in addition to the main operation executed by the statement.
