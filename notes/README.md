			HOUR 1
<pre>
-> C is a high-level programming language.
-> C is portable, readable, and easily maintained.
-> American National Standards Instute(ANSI) built the standard library.
-> Programs in C must be compiled before they can be used.
</pre>
			HOUR 2
<pre>
-> Source code for C programs must have a .c extension.
-> /*....*/ are used to indicate comments in C.
-> Comments help document specific sections or functions do in the program.
-> ANSI does not support nested comments.
-> In C, #include forms a preprocessor directive that tells the C preprocessor to look for a file and place the contents of that file in the location where the #include directive indicates.
-> Header files are placed at the start of the file.
-> The angle <> brackets ask the C preprocessor to look for a header file in a directory other than the current one.
-> The "" double quotes tell the preprocessor to look in the current directory for the file requested.
-> Every C program must have main() function and it can only be one.
-> exit() function can also be used to end a program but does not return a value to your program.
-> Program errors are also called bugs.
</pre>
			HOUR 3
<pre>
-> A constant is a value that never changes.
-> A variable can be used to represent different values.
-> An expression is a combination of constants, variables, and operators that are used to
denote computations.
-> % is used to obtain the remainder of the first operand divided by the second
operand. Also called the modulus operator.
-> A statement is a complete instruction, ending with a semicolon.
-> A function name should reflect what it can do.
-> Arguments are pieces of information passed to a function.
</pre>
			HOUR 4
<pre>
-> ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange.
-> A char takes up 1 byte of storage.
-> char variablename;
-> %c is the character format specifier.
-> Character constant is enclosed in single quotes.
-> A string of more than one character uses double quotes.
-> int keyword is used to specify the type of a variable as an integer.
-> int variablename;
-> %d is an integer format specifier.
-> A floating-point number has a decimal point.
-> float variablename;
-> %f is the floating-point specifier.
-> A double uses twice the storage for a float.
-> Floating-point numbers can be suffixed with f or F to specify float. A floatingpoint number without a suffix is double by default.
-> %c is used for character set only.
</pre>
			HOUR 5
<pre>
-> C language treats a file as a series of bytes(stream).
-> stdin — The standard input for reading.
-> stdout—The standard output for writing.
-> stderr—The standard error for writing error messages.
-> The above three files are pre-opened and always available to use.
-> Hex is a compromise between the computer-readable
base-2 (or binary) number system, and our more familiar base-10 (or decimal) system.
-> %x or %X are the unsigned hexadecimal format specifiers.
-> A hexadecimal number is represented by 4 bits.
-> Minimum field width specifier specifies the minimum field width and ensures that the output reaches the minimum width.
-> A positive integer between the % and the specifier aligns the output to the right.
-> A negative integer between the % and the specifier aligns the output to the left.
-> The C library functions getc() and getchar() can be used to read in one character
from the standard input.
-> The C library functions putc() and putchar() can be used to write one character
to the standard output.
</pre>
			#HOUR 6#
<pre>
-> The assignment operator = assigns whatever value is held on the right to the variable on the left.
-> Arithmetic assignment operator is a combination of the assignment operators with arithmetic operators(+=, -=, /=, %=).
-> ++x represents pre-increment, whereas x++ represents post-increment.
-> --x represents pre-decrement, whereas x-- represents post-decrement.
-> Pre refers to first evaluate then assign, while Post means assign then evaluate.
-> Relational operators evaluate to either 1 when the evaluation is true, and 0 when the evaluation is false.
-> Arithmetic operators have precedence over relational operators.
-> Cast operator changes the data type of a variable, expression, or constant.
</pre>
			#HOUR 7#
<pre>
-> Looping can be used to perform the same set of statements over and over until
specified conditions are met.
-> There are three statements, while, and do-while, and for, that are used for looping in C.

-> The while statement contains one expression, which is the conditional expression
which controls the loop.
-> The do-while statement places its conditional expression at the bottom of the loop and ends with a semicolon.
-> There are three expressions in the for statement. The second expression is the conditional expression.
-> Multiple expressions, combined via commas, can be used as one expression in the
for statement.
